# Rubiks-Cube-Detection-and-Reconstruction
Solving Rubric cube sequence of steps performed in the Algorithm Developed:
1. Recognize each face of the Rubiks cube
2. Identify the colors on all faces of the cube
3. Construct the 3D model of the rubiks cube 
4. From the 3D model of the cube get the current position of the cube
5. Then with the current cube state as the start state and the solved cube as the goal state output all the moves which desrcibe the state of the cube into a text file.
6. Then use this information to simulate the solving of cube using a GUI
